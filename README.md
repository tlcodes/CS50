# CS50

This is CS50 (edX / HarvardX) - Introduction to Computer Science

These are my submits of problem sets of the CS50x course (from edX / HarvardX)
that can be accessed here:
https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x

From week 0 to week 11, the course includes lectures from David J Malan, as well
as shorts and walkthroughs from the CS50 staff. Each week asks for a project,
and I'm uploading my files here on GitHub .
(so I practice Git and GitHub at the same time!)
